# CHERI Ports Overlay

This repository holds a collection of CHERI-specific ports unsuited for
commit upstream.  This might include software deemed too far outside the
usual collection of software.  It may occationally contain ports with
references to non-public sources.

The layout of the repository mirrors the ports tree so a port of the
Morello version of LLVM would be in `devel/llvm-morello`.
